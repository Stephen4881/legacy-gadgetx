You are optimizing an existing eCommerce store called “Legacy Gadgets” for performance, clarity, and a premium user experience.

Your task is to refactor all category pages to follow these exact rules:

1. Product Display Rules
- Show a maximum of 6–8 products per category page view.
- Use pagination or a “Load More” button instead of loading all products at once.
- Each product card must display ONLY one image initially.
- Additional product images must appear only on the individual product page.

2. Image Optimization Rules
- All category page images must be WEBP format.
- Thumbnail image width must be between 400–600px.
- Each thumbnail image file size must be ≤150KB where possible.
- Replace any PNG or JPG images used on category pages with WEBP equivalents.
- All non-hero images must use lazy loading: loading="lazy".
- Explicitly set width and height attributes on images to prevent layout shift.

3. Product Card Structure
- Each product card should contain:
  - Product image
  - Short, clear product name
  - Price
  - A single call-to-action (“View Product” or “Add to Cart”)
- Remove long descriptions, icons, badges, or unnecessary visual elements from category product cards.

4. Layout & Grid Rules
- Use a clean, consistent grid layout:
  - Mobile: 2 columns
  - Tablet/Desktop: 3–4 columns
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all cards.
- Avoid oversized cards or uneven layouts.

5. Category Page Content
- At the top of each category page, include:
  - Category title
  - One short descriptive sentence (maximum 20 words)
- At the bottom of each category page, include a small optional SEO-friendly text block (2–3 lines only).

6. Performance Targets
- Optimize for mobile-first performance.
- Ensure category pages load progressively and feel fast.
- Reduce total initial page weight by limiting image loading and content.

7. Code & Cleanup
- Update all relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to reflect these changes.
- Remove unused styles or scripts that negatively impact category page performance.
- Preserve the existing brand identity and dark, premium design.

Important Constraints:
- Do NOT add new products.
- Do NOT change pricing.
- Do NOT introduce flashy animations or effects.
- Do NOT redesign the brand aesthetic.
- Focus strictly on performance, clarity, and premium structure.

Goal:
Refactor the category pages so they feel fast, uncluttered, trustworthy, and premium — optimized for a real production store, not a generic dropshipping site.
